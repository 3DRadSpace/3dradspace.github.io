			<h1>Home</h1>
			<p>
				Hello there,
			</p>
			<p>
				You are looking right now at the main page of my most important personal
				project I'm working on. 3DRadSpace is a remake of an older game engine
				called 3D Rad which was a really big part of my entire game
				developing experience, since it introduced me to game developing.
			</p>

			<p>
				I was initially about 10 years old when I first used 3D Rad and made a simple
				car game. Now after many years, with decent programming skills, I'm
				creating this project in hope to inspire other people to start
				creating their own pieces of art.
			</p>

			<p>
				The goal of 3DRadSpace is to be a better and more modern engine than the original one.
				It already is as of writing this page (June 9, 2020), since C# is already supported, scripting is
				extremely more versatile and limitless than AngelScript. 3DRadSpace is
				also already faster than the original 3D Rad. The original engine took
				about 20 seconds to load a simple project containing a few SkinMesh
				objects, some scripts and some timers. 3DRadSpace is build
				using Monogame, so check that framework out, really good stuff.
			</p>

			<p>
				At this moment, it's just me, a lone developer trying to accomplish their dreams related to computer
				science and programming.
			</p>

			<p>
				Anyway, you probably came here to download my engine and give it a go.
				So check it out. Please note that bugs exists as this is in alpha stage.
			</p>

				and <a href="/https://3drad.boards.net/">3drad.boards.net</a> for encouraging me to keep working on this
				project.
